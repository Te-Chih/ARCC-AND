## Requirements
- python==3.8
- torch==2.0.1
- install requirements via  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data

Please download data:

- Aminer-18 https://www.aminer.cn/na-data (na-v2)

- WhoisWho-SND https://www.aminer.cn/billboard/whoiswho   (na-v1: From-Scratch Name Disambiguation )

Unzip the file and put the different datasets into the corresponding **data/{dataset}/raw/** directory.

The data directory is as follows:

    |- ARCC
       |- data
           |- Aminer-18
              |- raw
              |- processed
              |- pretrain_model
